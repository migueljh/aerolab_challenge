# Aerolab Challenge
# Challenge
The challenge is to build a catalog view for a loyalty program app.

# Criteria
Each product should have a visible price in points.
The user should be able to sort products by price, from highest to lowest, and vice-versa.
The user should be able to see how many points they have in their account.
There should be a clear way for the user to distinguish those products that they can redeem from those they cannot.
A “Redeem now” option should appear when the user interacts with a product that they have enough points to claim.
When the user doesn’t have enough points for a product, they should be able to see how many more points they need to claim it.
The user should not be able to redeem a product for which they don’t have enough points.
When the user clicks on the Redeem now button, the system should automatically deduct the item’s price from the users’ points.
